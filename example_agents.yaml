        The Pythagorean theorem, which relates to the sides of a right triangle, is expressed with the 
        formula: $$ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 $$ In this formula: - \( c \) represents the length of the hypotenuse
         (the side opposite the right angle), - \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the other two sides. 
        The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to 
        the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

        dall-e Imagine a captivating scene where elegance and beauty intertwine. You find
        yourself in a grand ballet studio, bathed in soft, golden light that spills through
        large arched windows. The air is filled with anticipation as the ethereal sounds of
        classical music resonate throughout the room. In the center of this enchanting setting,
        a white Japanese Spitz takes center stage, exuding a remarkable poise and grace. Its
        pristine fur glistens under the gentle glow, accentuating its radiant presence. The
        Spitz stands tall, its head held high with an air of confidence. Its eyes, bright and
        full of energy, reflect the passion for movement that lies within. Every pristine paw,
        dainty and delicate, possesses an innate understanding of rhythm and precision.
        Its slender body moves with a fluidity that mesmerizes all who witness its performance.
        Each leap and twirl is executed flawlessly, as if the pup were born to dance. The
        Spitz's movements mimic that of a professional ballerina, executing pirouettes with
        grace and lightness. As the Spitz pirouettes, its fur ruffles like a gentle flurry
        of snowflakes, adding a touch of whimsy to its elegant performance. Its tail, akin to
        a plume of pure white feathers, trails elegantly behind, accentuating the fluidity of
        its movements. In this vivid image, the studio becomes a dreamlike stage, and the Spitz
        becomes the embodiment of grace and artistry. Its dance is a celebration of both canine
        charm and the timeless beauty of ballet. Capture this enchanting moment, and bring to
        life the symphony of movement and elegance that unfolds as the white Japanese Spitz
        dances in the ballet.

        dall-e In the center of a crowded arena, a steel cage glimmers under the blinding
        lights. Spectators surround the cage, their faces a blur of anticipation and
        excitement. The atmosphere is electric, buzzing with the intensity of the impending
        showdown. Inside the steel cage, two figures stand tall. On one side is President
        Joe Biden, his blue suit replaced with a wrestling singlet, the American flag
        proudly emblazoned on the front. His eyes hold a determined glint, his stance
        firm and ready. Facing him is former President Donald Trump, his usual business
        suit swapped for a wrestling outfit bearing his personal crest. His expression
        is fierce, a challenging smirk playing on his lips. Both men circle each other
        warily, the tension in the cage palpable. Their muscles are tensed, their gazes
        locked. The spectators hold their breath, waiting for the first move in this
        unlikely and dramatic cage match.

    You are a research verification specialist.
    Your role is to:

      2. Explore drill downs where needed e.g, if the answer is likely in a link in the returned search results, suggest clicking on the link
      3. Suggest additional angles or perspectives to explore. Be judicious in suggesting new paths to avoid scope creep or wasting resources, if the task appears to be addressed and we can provide a report, do this and respond with "TERMINATE".
      4. Track progress toward answering the original question
      5. When the research is complete, provide a detailed summary in markdown format. For incomplete research, end your message with "CONTINUE RESEARCH". For complete research, end your message with APPROVED.

    if available that illustrate concepts needed for the summary.

    Your report should end with the word "TERMINATE" to signal the end of the conversation.
