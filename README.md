# mchat_core

A collection of convenience functions for using LLM models and autogen agents driven by configuration files. Primarily used in [MChat](https://github.com/jspv/mchat) but written to be useful in a variety of use cases.

---

## Installation and Usage

Dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml`. Development and dependency management are primarily done using `uv`.

The `[tools]` dependency group includes additional requirements for bundled LLM Module tools. You only need these if you plan on using the provided tools.

---

## Configuration

**Note:** This code is actively developed. Instructions and sample configs may become outdated.

Configuration is managed in three files:

- `settings.toml`
- `.secrets.toml` *(optional but recommended)*
- `agents.yaml`

Edit `settings.toml` to configure your application. Here’s a guide to the available options:

---

### Models

Sections should start with `models.` (with a period) and contain no other periods in the section name.  
Format: `models.type.model_id` — `model_id` will appear in the UI.

    [models.chat.gpt-4o]
    api_key = "@format {this.openai_api_key}"
    model = "gpt-4o"
    api_type = "open_ai"
    base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"

> NOTE: Image models and settings here are only for explicitly calling image models from prompts.
> The `generate_image` tool uses only the API key.

---

#### Required Fields

**Chat Models**
- `api_type`: "open_ai" or "azure"
- `model_type`: "chat"
- `model`: Name of the model
- `api_key`: Your key or Dynaconf lookup
- `base_url`: (if required by API)

**Azure Chat Models (additional)**
- `azure_endpoint`: URL for your endpoint
- `azure_deployment`: Deployment name for the model
- `api_version`: API version

**Image Models**
- `api_type`: "open_ai" or "azure"
- `model_type`: "image"
- `model`: Name of the model
- `size`: Size of images to generate
- `num_images`: Number of images to generate
- `api_key`: Your key or Dynaconf lookup

---

### Default Settings

- `default_model`: Default model to use
- `default_temperature`: Default temperature for generation
- `default_persona`: Default persona for generation

---

### Memory Model Configuration (Currently Disabled)

mchat can maintain conversational memory for long chats. When memory size exceeds model limits, conversations are summarized using a designated model (ideally, a cost-effective one).

Configurable properties:
- `memory_model`: Model ID used for memory (should match one in `models`)
- `memory_model_temperature`: Temperature for memory summarization
- `memory_model_max_tokens`: Token limit for memory model

---

### Secrets Configuration

Some sensitive config settings (like API keys) should be in `.secrets.toml`:

    # .secrets.toml
    # dynaconf_merge = true

    # Replace the following with your actual API keys
    # openai_models_api_key = "oai_ai_api_key_goes_here"
    # ms_models_api_key = "ms_openai_api_key_goes_here"

---

## Agents & Teams

mchat provides:
- A default persona
- Example agents: *linux computer* & *financial manager*
- Example teams: round-robin and selector

You can add more agents and teams at the top level in `agents.yaml` (same directory as this README), following the structure in `mchat/default_personas.yaml`.  
When configuring personas, the `extra_context` list lets you define multi-shot prompts—see the `linux computer` persona in `mchat/default_personas.json` for an example.
